* Download the Windows standalone application.
* Launch the executable and wait for the MATLAB packages to finish downloading (the application requires internet access only during the initial launch). The application will open more quickly on subsequent launches.
* Feel free to use the application
* Any comments or feedback would be greatly appreciated ;-)
